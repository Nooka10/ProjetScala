This project was bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.io/).

## Instructions

Configure node_modules

### `yarn install`

To build the project, you can follow [these instructions](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v33.0.0/introduction/installation/)

First you need to install the Expo CLI

### `npm install -g expo-cli`

Then in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

And finally you need to install the Mobile Client on you device/simulator and run the app (if it's the first time you use Expo, you'll need to create an Expo account and login both on your computer and your smartphone). On Android, you can also just scan the QR Code generated by Expo.



Otherwise, you can trust us and install the .apk or .ipa packages =)
